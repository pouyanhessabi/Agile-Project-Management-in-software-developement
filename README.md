Today, with the advancement of technology and the increase of industrial projects, new methods for optimizing the project and management solutions for its implementation have become more important. One of the most used and popular project management methods that we discuss in this article is the agile method. In general, this method is based on repetition and cooperation, and in this approach, the different stages of work are divided into smaller parts and finally divided among all team members.
